# Pre-work - Tip Calcuator for iOS


Submitted by: Kunal Mody

Time spent: 25 hours in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- Settings page, where user can change the default values of the tip options
- Total bill/tip amount updates instantly as the user changes bill amount
- $ symbol cannot be deleted and cursor position cannot be before the $ symbol

## Notes

Becoming acquainted with Swift was not too difficult, especially because of my experience with OOP in Java; however, event-based programming is still new to me, and so developing this app did have its challenges when dealing with changes in user input.
